Need Statement: Professional Directory

The proposed system will enable mission leaders to more expediently assess and target professional relationships that are conducive/detrimental in light of current market trends.  This professional hierarchy need include all former partners and incidental associates.  It should also function to easily display internal analysis of relationships as they pertain to various categories of key milestones to reach corporate objectives.

	At a minimum, the system must be able to update but hold all previous versions of internal documentation.  Contacts should be able to be referenced according to multiple properties and should have the capacity to reflect changes in status (such as merger/acquisitions).  All entities must be easily discernable by industry/services provided and possibly by area of special expertise.
	
	Deeper features may include special indicators for:  entities (1) whose performance merited changes in applicable law, (2) distribute products in only select areas, (3) operate under very specific protocols, etc. It may be necessary to include options where special consideration need be heeded in engaging with a particular entity in any specified arena.  It may also be of use to include relevant information if an entity is more likely to engage in favorable cooperation as measured by any metric.
